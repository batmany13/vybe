## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**"No Lemlist campaign associated"**
- ✅ Select a campaign when creating/editing the update

- ✅ Check that LPs have `status = 'active'` 
- ✅ Ensure LPs have valid email addresses
- ✅ Verify LP data in the Limited Partners section

**Launch Failures**

- ✅ **"Invalid email format"**: Fix the LP's email address
- ✅ **"Campaign not found"**: Campaign may have been deleted in Lemlist
- ✅ **"Rate limit exceeded"**: Wait a few minutes and try again

### Performance Tips
